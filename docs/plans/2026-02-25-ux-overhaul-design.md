# ChromaDMX UX Overhaul Design

**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Status**: Approved

## Design Philosophy

Retro pixel-art aesthetic with LED matrix elements for fixture displays. Linear, zero-thought UX. A pixel character co-pilot makes the app feel alive. Everything auto-discovers, auto-configures, and the user just picks vibes.

## 1. First Launch Flow (Linear Onboarding)

1. **Splash** — Pixel-art ChromaDMX logo assembles from scattered pixels, beat-synced animation
2. **Network Discovery** — Full-screen pixel animation of the mascot "scanning" for lights. Art-Net auto-discovery runs behind the animation. Nodes appear as pixel icons connecting via animated pixel wires. If no hardware: mascot offers "No lights found — want a virtual stage?"
3. **Fixture Scan** — If real hardware: camera-based spatial mapping with pixel-art overlay showing detected fixtures lighting up on a grid. If simulation: auto-loads selected rig preset with animation
4. **Vibe Check** — Mascot asks "What's tonight's vibe?" with genre tiles (Techno, House, DnB, Ambient, etc.). Agent generates a tailored scene pack. Universal presets available immediately while generation happens
5. **Stage Preview** — User lands on the main screen with their rig visualized and first preset active

**Repeat launches**: Skip straight to stage preview. Mascot alerts if network state changed.

## 2. Stage Preview (Main Screen)

**Top-down pixel grid** (default) — Bird's-eye venue view. Each fixture rendered as a pixel block colored by active effect in real-time. Trusses are rows of pixel segments, moving heads show beam direction as a pixel cone, pars are single blocks.

**Front-facing stage view** (swipe to toggle) — Audience perspective. Trusses as horizontal pixel bars, moving heads with visible beam angles, pixel bars as segmented strips.

Both views use the **LED matrix aesthetic** — the stage preview area looks like you're viewing a pixel LED wall.

**Bottom strip**: Horizontal scrollable preset thumbnails. Each preset is a mini pixel-art stage preview showing its color pattern. Tap to apply, long-press to preview.

**Top bar**: Compact network health indicator, BPM display (beat-reactive), master dimmer.

## 3. Fixture Profile System

Open Fixture Library-inspired profiles. Each fixture profile defines:

- **Channel layout**: ordered list of named channels with type (dimmer, red, green, blue, pan, tilt, gobo, color wheel, focus, zoom, strobe, etc.)
- **Capabilities**: color mixing mode (RGB, CMY, color wheel), movement (pan/tilt ranges), gobo wheel slots
- **Physical properties**: beam angle, movement range (degrees), pixel count (for bars)
- **Rendering hints**: how to display in stage preview (point, bar, beam cone)

**Built-in profiles**: Generic RGB Par, Generic Moving Head, Pixel Bar (8/16/32 segment), Strobe, Wash, Spot.

**Custom profiles**: Users can create via the agent ("I have a Chauvet Intimidator Spot 360 at address 100") or manual channel mapping.

## 4. Pixel Mascot / AI Companion

**Character**: Small pixel-art lighting tech robot. 16x16 pixel sprite with animation frames.

**States & animations**:
- **Idle**: Subtle breathing animation, pulses with beat
- **Thinking**: Pixel loading animation (spinning pixel dots)
- **Happy**: Small jump + sparkle pixels (network connected, scene generated)
- **Alert**: Exclamation pixel bubble (node disconnected, issue detected)
- **Confused**: Head tilt + question pixel bubble (troubleshooting)

**Behavior**:
- Lives in bottom-right corner of screen (movable)
- Proactive inline suggestions appear as pixel speech bubbles
- Tap to open full chat panel (slides up from bottom)
- Beat-reactive during performances (dances/pulses)

## 5. Simulation Mode

First-class feature, not hidden dev toggle.

- If no real hardware found during network discovery, mascot offers virtual stage
- User picks from preset rigs: Small DJ (8 pars), Truss Rig (30 bars), Festival Stage (100+), or Custom
- Simulated camera generates synthetic frames for vision/mapping flow
- Entire app works identically — effects render on virtual fixtures, stage preview updates in real-time
- Clear "SIMULATION" pixel badge so users know they're in sandbox mode
- Can mix real + simulated fixtures (test new fixtures virtually before patching)

## 6. Networking UX

Auto-discovery is the default — no manual config screens.

- Network issues surfaced by mascot inline: "Lost connection to Node 3 — want me to diagnose?"
- One-tap diagnostic: mascot runs `diagnoseConnection`, shows results as simple pixel status cards
- Manual config available but buried (settings → advanced → network)
- Node health shown as pixel heart icons in status bar (full heart = healthy, half = degraded, empty = lost)

## 7. Preset & Effect Library

- **Universal presets** (5-6) ship built-in, work offline, no API key needed
- **Genre packs** generated by agent during onboarding vibe check
- **User presets** saved from current state, tagged by genre
- **Agent generation** available anytime: "Generate 10 scenes for dark techno"
- **Smart suggestions**: Mascot occasionally suggests scene changes based on tempo/time

## 8. Screen Architecture (Compose MP)

Old structure (4 tabs: Perform, Network, Map, Agent) → New linear structure:

1. **Onboarding Flow** (first launch only) — splash → network → scan → vibe check
2. **Stage Preview** (main screen) — dual-view fixture visualization + preset strip + mascot
3. **Settings** (gear icon) — network advanced config, fixture profiles, simulation toggle, agent API keys
4. **Chat Panel** (tap mascot) — slide-up agent chat with full conversation + tool visualization

No tab bar. Single main screen with the stage preview. Everything else is accessed contextually.

## 9. MVP Gaps Identified

Beyond the UX overhaul, these gaps need filling for a functional MVP:

- **Fixture profile system** — Current model is RGB-only, needs channel abstraction
- **Moving head support** — Pan/tilt rendering in stage preview, channel mapping
- **Onboarding state machine** — First launch vs repeat launch logic
- **Preset persistence** — Save/load scene presets to local storage
- **Simulated camera in UI** — Wire SimulatedCamera into the vision flow for testing
- **Beat visualization** — BPM display and beat-reactive UI elements
- **Error recovery UX** — Node dropout handling, reconnection flows
- **Pixel art asset pipeline** — Mascot sprites, animations, UI elements
