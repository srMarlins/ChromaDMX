      This is a Kotlin Multiplatform (Android + iOS) DMX lighting controller.
      Shared code lives in shared/, platform code in android/ and ios/.
      Key conventions:
      - Dependency injection via Koin Multiplatform
      - Coroutines for async, StateFlow for observable state
      - expect/actual for platform abstractions
      - DMX output path must be pure shared Kotlin
      - Three independent loops (UI/Engine/DMX) must never block each other
      Review for: thread safety, coroutine misuse, platform leaks in shared code,
      proper DI scoping, and DMX timing constraints.
